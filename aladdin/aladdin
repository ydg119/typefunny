Oh, I come from a land from a far away place.
Where the caravan camels roam.
Where It's flat and immense and the heat is intense.
It's barbaric but hey, it's home.
When the wind's from the east and the sun's from the west.
And the sand in the glass is right.
Come on down, stop on by hop a carpet and fly.
To another Arabian night.
Arabian nights.
Like Arabian days.
More often than not are hotter than hot.
In a lot of good ways.
Arabian nights.
Neath Arabian moons.
A fool off his guard could fall and fall hard.
Out there on the dunes.
camel panting.
Ah, salaam, and good evening to you, worthy friend.
Please, please, come closer.
Too close. A little too close.
There.
Welcome to Agrabah.
city of mystery.
of enchantment.
and the finest merchandise this side of the river Jordan, on sale today.
Look at this, Yes.
Combination hookah and coffeemaker. Also makes julienne fries.
Will not break, will not.
It broke.
Ohh! Look at this.
I have never seen one of these intact before.
This is the famous Dead Sea Tupperware.
Listen, Ah, still good.
Wait, Dont go.
I can see that you're only interested in the exceptionally rare.
I think, then, you would be most rewarded to consider this.
Do not be fooled by its commonplace apperance.
Like so many things, it is not what is outside.
but what is inside that counts.
This is no ordinary lamp.
It once changed the course of a young man's life.
A young man who like this lamp, was more than what hs seemed.
The diamond in the rough.
Perhaps you would like to hear the tale.
It begins on a dark night...
where a dark man waits.
with a dark purpose.
horse nickers.
you are late.
A thousand apologies, O patient One.
You have it then?
I had to slit a few throats, but I got it.
Ah-ah-ahhh.
The treasure.
Ow!
Trust me, my pungent friend.
You'll get what's coming to you. What's coming to you. Awk!
Quickly! Follow the trail.
Faster.
horse neighs.
wind howling.
At last, after all my years of searching...
the Cave of Wonders.
Awk. Cave of Wonders.
By Allah.
Now, remember. Bring me the lamp.
The rest of treasure is yours, the lamp is mine.
Awk, the lamp.
Awk, the lamp.
Shh.
echoing rumble.
Who disturbs my slumber?
thief gasps.
It is I, Gazeem.
a humble thief.
know this.
Only one may enter here.
One whose worth lies far within.
A diamond in the rough.
What are you waiting for? Go on.
beast sighing.
roaring, screaming.
No.
Seek thee out the diamond in the rough.
coughing.
I cant believe it, I just dont believe it.
We're never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp.
Just forget it. Look at this.
I'm so ticked off that I'm molting.
Patience, lago, Patience.
Gazeem was obviously less than worthy.
Oh, there's a big surprise.
I think I'm gonna have a heart attack and die from that surprise.
What are we gonna do, We got a big problem here, a big...
Yes.
Only one may enter.
I must find this one, this...
diamond in the rough.
Stop! Thief!
I'll have your hands for a trophy, street rat.
All this for a loaf of bread?
Whoa!
screaming
There he is! You wont get away so easy.
You think that was easy?
gigging.
You two, over that way, and you, follow me.
We'll find him.
Morning, ladies.
Getting into trouble a little early today, arent we, Aladdin?
Trouble, No way. You're only in trouble if you get caught.
Gotcha. I'm in trouble.
And this time.
Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.
Abu, Come on. Let's get outta here.
Gotta keep one jump ahead of the bread line.
One swing ahead of the sword.
I steal only what I cant afford.
That's everything.
One jump ahead of the lawmen.
That's all and that's no joke.
These guys dont appreciate I'm broke.
Riffraff. Street rat.
Scoundrel. Take that.
Just a little snack, guys.
Rip him open, Take it back, guys.
I can take a hint gotta face the facts.
You're my only friend, Abu.
Who?
Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom.
He's become a one-man rise in crime.
I'd blame parents except he hasnt got em.
Gotta eat to live, Gotta steal to eat.
Tell you all about it when I got the time.
One jump ahead of the slowpokes, One skip ahead of my doom.
Next time gonna use a nom de plume.
There hs is.
One jump ahead of the hit men, One hit of the flock
I think I'll take a stroll around the block.
Stop, thief. Vandal.
Abu! Scandal.
Let's not be too hasty.
Still I think hs's rather tasty.
Gotta eat to live Gotta steal to eat.
Otherwise we'd get along.
Wrong.
Get him.
He's got a sword.
You idiots, We've all got swords.
One jump ahead of the hoofbeats. Vandal.
One hop ahead of the hump, Street rat.
One trick ahead of disaster, Scoundrel.
They're quick, but I'm much faster.
Here goes, better throw my hand in.
Wish me happy landin, all I gotta do is jump.
screaming
And now, esteemed effendi, we feast.
All right.
Yum, Yum.
Uh-oh.
Here go on, take it.
Ah dont.
On his way to the palace, I suppose.
Another suitor for the princess.
Out of my way, you filthy brats.
Hey.
If I were as rich as you, I could afford some manners.
Look at that, Abu.
It's not every day you see a horse with two rear ends.
You are a worthless street rat.
You were born a street rat, you'll die a street rat.
and only your fleas will mourn you.
I'm not worthless.
And I dont have fleas.
Come on, Abu. Let's go home.
Riffraff, street rat.
I dont buy that.
If only they'd look closer.
Would they see a poor boy.
No, siree.
They'd find out.
There's so much more.
To me.
Some day, Abu, things are gonna change.
We'll be rich, live in a palace.
and never have any problems at all.
I've never been so insulted.
Oh, Price Achmed. You're not leaving so soon, are you.
Good luck marrying her off.
Oh, Jasmine.
Jasmine.
Confound it, Rajah.
So, this is why Prince Achmed stormed out.
Oh, father.
Rajah was just playing with him. Weren't you, Rajah.
You were just palying with that self-absorbed Prince Achmed, weren't you?
Dearest, you're got to stop rejecting every suitor who comes to call.
The law says you must be married to a prince.
by your next birthday.
The law is wrong.
You've only got three more days.
Father, I hate being forced into this.
If I do marry, I want it to be for love.
Jasmine
It's not only this law.
I'm not going to be around forever, and , well, I ...
I just want to make sure you're taken care of.
Provided for.
Please try to understand.
I've never done a thing on my own, I've never had any friend.
Except you, Rajah.
I've never even been outside the palace walls.
But, Jasmine, you're a princess.
Then maybe I dont want to be a princess anymore.
Ooooh! I... I...
Allah, forbid you should have any daughters.
Hmm?
I dont know where she gets it from.
Her mother wasnt nearly so picky.
Oh, Ah, Jafar.
My most trusted advisor.
I am in desperate need of your wisdom.
My life is but to serve you, my lord.
It's this suitor business.
Jasmine refuses to choose a husband.
I'm at my wit's end, Awk! Wit's end.
Have a cracker, pretty Polly.
Your Majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals.
Now, then perhaps I can divine a solution to this thorny problem.
If anyone can help, It's you.
But it would require the use of the mystic blue diamond.
Oh, Uh, my ring?
But it's been in the family for years.
It is necessary to find the princess a suitor.
Dont worry.
Everything will be fine.
Everything will be fine.
The diamond.
Here, Jafar.
Whatever you need will be fine.
You are most gracious, my liege.
Now run along and play with your little toys, hmm?
Yes, That will be pretty good.
I cant take it anymore.
If I gotta choke down on one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers.
Bam! Whack!
Calm yourself, lago.
Then I'd grab him aroud the head. Whack!
Soon I will be suitan, not that addle-pated twit.
And then I stuff the crackers down his throat.
Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.
But I cant stay here and have my life lived for me.
I'll miss you.
Goodbye.
Okay, Abu, Go.
Try this, your taste buds will dance and sing.
Get your paws off that.
Why, you...
Get away from here, you cursed, filthy ape.
Goodbye.
Nice going, Abu.
Breakfast is served.
Pretty lady, buy a pot.
No finer pot in brass or silver.
Sugar dates, Sugar dates and figs.
Sugar dates and pistachios.
Would the lady like a necklace?
A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.
Fresh fish.
We catch them, you but them.
Oh, no, I dont think so.
Oh!
Excuse me.
I'm really very sorry.
Wow.
Uh-oh.
Hello? Hello?
Oh, you must be hungry.
Here you go.
You'd better be able to pay for that.
Pay?
No one steals from my cart.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I dont have any money.
Thief, Please.
If you let me go to the palace, I can get some from the Sultan.
Do you know what the penalty is for stealing.
No, No, please.
Thank you, kind sir, I'm so glad you found her.
I've been looking all over for you.
What are you doing? Just play along.
You, uh, know this girl?
Sadly, yes. She is my sister.
She's a little crazy.
She said she knew the Sultan.
She thinks the monkey is the Sultan.
O wise SUltan, how may I serve you?
Tragic, isn't it?
But no harm done.
Now, come along, sis. Time to go see the doctor.
Oh, hello, Doctor. How are you?
