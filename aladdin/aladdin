Oh, I come from a land from a far away place.
Where the caravan camels roam.
Where It's flat and immense and the heat is intense.
It's barbaric but hey, it's home.
When the wind's from the east and the sun's from the west.
And the sand in the glass is right.
Come on down, stop on by hop a carpet and fly.
To another Arabian night.
Arabian nights.
Like Arabian days.
More often than not are hotter than hot.
In a lot of good ways.
Arabian nights.
Neath Arabian moons.
A fool off his guard could fall and fall hard.
Out there on the dunes.
camel panting.
Ah, salaam, and good evening to you, worthy friend.
Please, please, come closer.
Too close. A little too close.
There.
Welcome to Agrabah.
city of mystery.
of enchantment.
and the finest merchandise this side of the river Jordan, on sale today.
Look at this, Yes.
Combination hookah and coffeemaker. Also makes julienne fries.
Will not break, will not.
It broke.
Ohh! Look at this.
I have never seen one of these intact before.
This is the famous Dead Sea Tupperware.
Listen, Ah, still good.
Wait, Dont go.
I can see that you're only interested in the exceptionally rare.
I think, then, you would be most rewarded to consider this.
Do not be fooled by its commonplace apperance.
Like so many things, it is not what is outside.
but what is inside that counts.
This is no ordinary lamp.
It once changed the course of a young man's life.
A young man who like this lamp, was more than what hs seemed.
The diamond in the rough.
Perhaps you would like to hear the tale.
It begins on a dark night...
where a dark man waits.
with a dark purpose.
horse nickers.
you are late.
A thousand apologies, O patient One.
You have it then?
I had to slit a few throats, but I got it.
Ah-ah-ahhh.
The treasure.
Ow!
Trust me, my pungent friend.
You'll get what's coming to you. What's coming to you. Awk!
Quickly! Follow the trail.
Faster.
horse neighs.
wind howling.
At last, after all my years of searching...
the Cave of Wonders.
Awk. Cave of Wonders.
By Allah.
Now, remember. Bring me the lamp.
The rest of treasure is yours, the lamp is mine.
Awk, the lamp.
Awk, the lamp.
Shh.
echoing rumble.
Who disturbs my slumber?
thief gasps.
It is I, Gazeem.
a humble thief.
know this.
Only one may enter here.
One whose worth lies far within.
A diamond in the rough.
What are you waiting for? Go on.
beast sighing.
roaring, screaming.
No.
Seek thee out the diamond in the rough.
coughing.
I cant believe it, I just dont believe it.
We're never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp.
Just forget it. Look at this.
I'm so ticked off that I'm molting.
Patience, lago, Patience.
Gazeem was obviously less than worthy.
Oh, there's a big surprise.
I think I'm gonna have a heart attack and die from that surprise.
What are we gonna do, We got a big problem here, a big...
Yes.
Only one may enter.
I must find this one, this...
diamond in the rough.
Stop! Thief!
I'll have your hands for a trophy, street rat.
All this for a loaf of bread?
Whoa!
screaming
There he is! You wont get away so easy.
You think that was easy?
gigging.
You two, over that way, and you, follow me.
We'll find him.
Morning, ladies.
Getting into trouble a little early today, arent we, Aladdin?
Trouble, No way. You're only in trouble if you get caught.
Gotcha. I'm in trouble.
And this time.
Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.
Abu, Come on. Let's get outta here.
Gotta keep one jump ahead of the bread line.
One swing ahead of the sword.
I steal only what I cant afford.
That's everything.
One jump ahead of the lawmen.
That's all and that's no joke.
These guys dont appreciate I'm broke.
Riffraff. Street rat.
Scoundrel. Take that.
Just a little snack, guys.
Rip him open, Take it back, guys.
I can take a hint gotta face the facts.
You're my only friend, Abu.
Who?
Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom.
He's become a one-man rise in crime.
I'd blame parents except he hasnt got em.
Gotta eat to live, Gotta steal to eat.
Tell you all about it when I got the time.
One jump ahead of the slowpokes, One skip ahead of my doom.
Next time gonna use a nom de plume.
There hs is.
One jump ahead of the hit men, One hit of the flock
I think I'll take a stroll around the block.
Stop, thief. Vandal.
Abu! Scandal.
Let's not be too hasty.
